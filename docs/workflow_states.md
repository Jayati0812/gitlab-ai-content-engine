# AI Workflow States

A content job moves through a series of states during the AI documentation lifecycle, from source document upload to final Markdown publication.

## State Table

| Status | Meaning | Set by |
|---|---|---|
| `uploaded` | Source document has been uploaded and is ready for processing | Content Intake |
| `reading` | Technical context is extracted and supporting knowledge is retrieved | Context Reader |
| `writing` | The initial documentation draft is generated | Documentation Writer |
| `fact_checking` | Generated content is verified against the uploaded source | Fact Checker |
| `tone_editing` | Clarity, structure, and audience-appropriate tone are improved | Tone Editor |
| `ready_for_human_review` | AI processing is complete and the draft is waiting for human review | AI Workflow |
| `approved` | The human reviewer has approved the documentation | Human Reviewer |
| `revision_requested` | The human reviewer has requested changes to the draft | Human Reviewer |
| `publishing` | Approved content is being prepared for publication | Publishing Coordinator |
| `published` | Final documentation has been generated as Markdown | Publishing Coordinator |
| `failed` | The workflow encountered an AI or system execution error | AI Workflow |

# Workflow Notes
- The uploaded document is the primary source of truth for the AI workflow.
- During reading, the Context Reader extracts relevant technical context from the uploaded document.
- The Context Reader can also retrieve supporting information from Chroma, such as style guides, sample documentation, and content templates.
- Chroma provides supporting context and does not replace the uploaded source.
- During writing, the Documentation Writer uses the verified context to generate the initial documentation draft.
- During fact_checking, the Fact Checker verifies generated claims against the uploaded source and identifies unsupported or incorrect information.
- During tone_editing, the Tone Editor improves clarity, structure, and audience-appropriate tone while preserving verified technical information.
- ready_for_human_review is a mandatory human checkpoint. Content is not published automatically after the AI workflow.
- If the reviewer approves the draft, the workflow moves to approved and then publishing.
- If the reviewer requests changes, the workflow moves to revision_requested, and the feedback is sent back to the Documentation Writer.
- After revision, the content goes through Writer → Fact Checker → Tone Editor → Human Review again.
- Previous versions can be retained so that revisions and review decisions remain traceable.
- The Publishing Coordinator prepares approved documentation as a Markdown export.
- published is the final state in the current MVP.
- failed represents an AI or system execution error and is separate from a human-requested revision.
